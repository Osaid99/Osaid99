            Spring:
        </oh1>
        <p>The duration of spring in Pakistan is from February to April. The weather in spring is moderate neither too
            hot nor too cold.<br> The chillness of the earth gains the warmth of the sun. During spring, there is
            greenery everywhere; the plants start growing<br> and blooming beautiful flowers and bearing fruits.</p>

    <h2>
        Summer:
    </h2>
    <P>Summer is the longest season in most parts of the country. As such, the summer months in Pakistan usually begin
        from April<br> and last in September. Since the duration is quite long, the weather gets extremely harsh from
        May to July while the mid of July<br> usually calls for monsoon and thunderstorms.</P>

    <h3>
        AUTMN:
    </h3>
    <P> Fall comes in early October on the plains, to the mountainous areas even sooner â€“ in the beginning of September.
        There is no <br>other type of weather, but only cold winter one in the highlands. Fall is very soft and nice
        period and is the best time to see <br>country all around.</P>

    <h4>
        WINTER:
    </h4>
    <p>Winter starts from November and ends in March and it is considered as the coldest season of the year. As the
        winter starts<br> knocking on the door of Pakistan, fish marketing got more momentum because the consumption
        rate becomes multiple as<br> compared to the summer.</p>
